## What Do You Love So Much About Taylor Swift?

I really respect her integrity. She‚Äôs worked hard to always better herself based on critics (‚Äúshe
didn‚Äôt write all her own songs‚Äù, ‚Äúher voice isn‚Äôt strong enough‚Äù, etc), has been in a mentally
abusive relationship (with Kanye. She sought his approval for a very long time after he interrupted
her award, until just a few years ago, before coming to the realization he was two-faced). She tries
to be as honest as possible. That tape that Kim & Kanye released to make her look bad? Turns out,
after time passed, they admitted it was edited. 

She gets a lot of flak because she writes songs about breakups, yet in interviews that focus on that
point, she always brings up the point that they never ask those types of questions to male
vocalists. She never names names about people songs may be about, regardless of public intrigue. She
kept getting asked if she planned to settle down when she turned 30, and she flipped the tables
again that they would never ask a man that question.

When Apple announced a *90 day free trial* for their new Music subscription service, they didn‚Äôt intend
to pay the artists during that time.  [She wrote an open letter to
them](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2015/06/21/taylor-swifts-letter-to-apple-stern-polite-and-necessary/?sh=5a16b8d5113d),
and it opened their eyes and they changed their minds.

When she changed record labels before *Lover* came out, she fought for control of her original
masters. The only way she could potentially gain control of them is if she were to re-sign with the
same label for an equivalent amount of albums (or something of the ilk). She instead chose to walk
away, and her new label agreement includes her masters, and she‚Äôs legally allowed (and has started)
to re-record songs from her first five albums. Her original masters up through *reputation*? They
were scooped up by someone with venture capital backing, and just resold with an agreement clause
that they could not even talk to her about it else the sale would be void.  [Here‚Äôs her statement on
that.](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425) 

When she was negotiating with her new label over streaming fees, her fees were going to be above the
normal. So,  [she asked that they raise all the currently signed artists to that same level, and
they
did](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/taylor-swift-universal-republic-deal-spotify-758102/). 

She‚Äôs donated money to a lot of charities, as any decent artist would, but one thing that stands out
to me is that  [she donated $250,000 to
Kesha](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-donates-250000-to-kesha-after-court-ruling-123036/)
after the ruling that would require Kesha to continue working with someone she said had raped her.

Then, there is her connection with fans. See
[Swiftmas](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6415161/taylor-swift-swiftmas), the
[Harvey Mudd college concert](https://www.hmc.edu/non-wp-sites/old-news/swift-concert.php), to
[performing in a local tavern because a fan emailed her asking to help with his marriage
proposal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/02/25/taylor-swift-helps-fan-propose-boyfriend-sings-king-my-heart/2978077002/).

She‚Äôs also gone on record stating that she always try her best to make sure fan favorites are always
performed at her concerts, because nothing stinks more than seeing your favorite artist perform
music *only from their most recent album*. If she has to perform *Love Story* at every gig, so be
it. I believe she mentions it  [in her interview with Paul McCartney via Rolling Stone
magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/paul-mccartney-taylor-swift-musicians-on-musicians-1089058/).

All of the above? That‚Äôs just her, as a person. That doesn‚Äôt even touch on her songwriting. 

I adore good lyrics, and she does not disappoint. They are simply amazing, getting better and better
with every new song or album. For me, songs that lyrically make no sense are hard to become engaged
with. That has never been a problem with her writing. Her story telling is second to none, at this
point. 

If you asked me to pick a favorite album, I couldn‚Äôt. They are all my favorite children. The best I
could do is point you to her masterpiece of a song, [All Too
Well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Jxo15Vfic). It hit right before she moved 100% over to pop
(so it still has some country roots), it doesn‚Äôt have a chorus, and even at over 5 minutes, it
doesn‚Äôt overstay it‚Äôs welcome. It also has some of the best story telling she‚Äôs ever done, with a
couple sets of lyrics that just hit perfectly.
