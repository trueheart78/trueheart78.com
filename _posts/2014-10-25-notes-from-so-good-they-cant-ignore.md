Earlier this year, I read the fantastic book [*So Good They Can't Ignore You*][so-good]
by Cal Newport. Here are the notes I took.

Career Capital = rare/valuable resources

* If you think of it as in supply & demand, then having rare/valuable resources
gives you leverage to get rare/valuable traits.
* A mission is one such trait, can be purchased with career capital to make your
life better.

Referenced books:  

* "[Where Good Ideas Come From][good-ideas]", By Steven Johnson  
* "[Born Standing Up][born-standing]", By Steve Martin


"Think small, act big"

* Focus on a narrow collection of subjects for potentially a long time. Once you
get to the cutting edge, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you
must go after it with zeal: a "big" action.

Rule of Financial Viability(?)

* New opportunity and you're not sure to take it?  
"Will someone pay me for this?"  
-> helps judge if valuable

_"Be so good they can't ignore you"_, - Steve Martin

Having proper control = Dream-job elixir  

* "I want your job!" = this

Deliberate practice will

* Help stop you from being plateaued
* Get you past the "acceptable level" you've been at
* "Feel the strain!"
* Log the hours of deliberate practice
* Collect/analyze at the monthly level

Pyramid:

* Top: Tentative Research Mission
* Middle: Exploratory Projects
* Bottom: Background Research

ACCOUNTABILITY

Little Bets & Experiments

* Short, less than a month long, where you can get feedback on quickly, and use
that to gauge the interest.

_As a developer, what matters most is writing good programs that do their job._

Capital Type: Write apps that work

Define "Good": Scripts / Apps being taken seriously

* Deliberate practice requires good goals

Stretch & Destroy:

* Doing what you know may be enjoyable, but deliberate practice
is, above all, an effort of focus and concentration. It's not like playing scales.

Be Patient:

* Be strong enough to reject new pursuits just because they're shiny - they are likely a distraction.

Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable.

* Personal Examples: Linux, Raspberry Pi setup

A mission (compelling direction?), not a passion.  
_"A good mission is... waiting to be discovered... at the cutting edge."_
