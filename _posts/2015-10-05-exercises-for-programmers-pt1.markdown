Started in on *Exercises for Programmers* tonight. Looks to be pretty
straightforward, but as I want to learn more than just Ruby, this provides
me with the opportunity to experiment a bit.

I'm not quite sure how I'll be differentiating posts for languages, or whether
I will at all. Regardless, I'm hoping to learn something new just by practicing.
