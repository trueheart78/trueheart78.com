2014 has been a very busy year for me. I've spent a lot more time this
year learning about technology that I would have never given a second
look at previously. I've become more adept at learning new 
technologies, and have turned the corner on "learning a new programming
language/technology is hard" to "feed me more", and have revitalized my
desire to make my work awesome.

If I had to give credit somewhere, I'd pin it on [Katrina Owen][katrina]
and [James Edward Gray II][jeg2], and, subsequently, [Cal Newport][cal]
and his fantastic book, ["So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love"][so-good].

Sometime early this year, I was listening to the
[Ruby Rogues podcast][rogues] and, during the picks, James selected what
he said was a book recommendation from Katrina: "So Good They Can't
Ignore You" by Cal Newport. I figured that, if these two high profile
developers that I looked at for wisdom and wit were both saying this was
a must read, then it was a must read.

As someone who had been doing development professionally for nearly
ten years, I was at a point in my career where I felt like I didn't
quite know where to go, but I knew that I couldn't stay in the same 
place any longer. I thought back to how much I used to enjoy programmming; even the excitement that just thinking about writing a system driver gave me.

I had stagnated. I enjoyed programming, but I didn't love my job the way I had hoped I would. 

Having been the lead software engineer where I work at for the last 4
years, it has taken this most recent year to show me what I can do if I
will just get uncomfortable and spend time learning and refining
myself. Whether that's new languages, new technologies (or anything else
that can have a skill level), deliberate practice has helped me map out
what I want to learn and why I want to get great at it.

I know I'm guilty of hawking other books to friends and colleagues, and
for good reason, but this is one of those books that, if you are
planning to work in the technology industry at all, you need to [read this][so-good].
