Years ago, I considered myself a Windows power user, and later tried out OS X
from 2007 to 2009. When the chance came to run back to Windows, I took it. OS X
wasn't what I wanted to use at that time. In 2012, my job was looking to migrate
the PHP-based web application we were running so it would work well on Linux.
Where did we start? With me committing heavily by using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as my
day-to-day OS. At first, in VirtualBox. After a few months, I moved over completely.

This is a review of those years I've spent, how I transitioned, and (as I move to
OS X for a new job), notes to my future self that I've enjoyed the deep-diving
I've done into system administration and Linux understanding.

## Ease Into It

I started using Ubuntu 12.04 through VirtualBox. My laptop was a quad core with
an SSD and 24GB of RAM, so giving it ample resources wasn't an issue. I started
small, at first. I learned about how much disk space I should go for, and then,
how to install my desired programs.

There were only one major issue, early-on. A replacement for Outlook that worked
with calendars (but wasn't Exchange-based), which ended up resolving itself as we
started moving over to Exchange and ended up having webmail-based Outlook. Once
that was resolved, I decided it was time to jump over completely.

## Commit to It

Around Christmas of 2012, I felt it was time to switch my OS out. Windows 7 was
being booted, and then I'd open the Ubuntu VM and go fullscreen. It was time to
jump over, and that brought with it exciting new opportunities, but also some
unforeseen issues.

My laptop at the time was a Lenovo Thinkpad W520, a beast of a system. The new
problem that arose had to do with the Optimus graphics. Using an external monitor
became a big challenge since the display port ran off from the Nvidia card, while
the screen ran off from the onboard Intel. If I valued battery life at all, I had
to run of the integrated chip.

## Roll With It

As much as an external monitor would have been nice, a fantastic workaround I had
discovered was using the virtual desktops in the OS. So instead of *"It'd be really
great to use an external monitor"*, I was able to change that to *"External monitor?
No, I'm good. I've got a 3x2 workspace environment setup that it will just mess up."*
I think that was my first real time of just rolling with it. "I can't have an
external monitor? Workspaces will do just fine then."

I'm actually not enthused about being in a multi-monitor relationship at all, now.
