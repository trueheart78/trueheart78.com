I had a really good New Year's Eve and Day. I spent a majority of both days watching conference talks from people that I saw speak live at RubyConf 2014, as well as from those I've only heard stories about (or chatted with in passing on Twitter).

Here's a list of those I've spent the end and beginning of a year with:

- Kerri Miller - [5 Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me About Programming Before I Started][kerri-1]
- Ernie Miller - [Ruby After Rails][ernie-1]
- Liz Abinante - [Programming, Education, and the American Dream][liz-1]
- Steve Klabnik - [Functional Reactive Programming][klabnik-1]
- Steve Klabnik - [Nobody Knows Rust][klabnik-2]
- Steve Klabnik - [Why Open?][klabnik-3]
- Steve Klabnik - [OOP and Philosophy][klabnik-4]
- Steve Klabnik - [Why should I care about Rails 4?][klabnik-5]
- Sandi Metz - [Madam Sandi Tells Your Future by Sandi Metz][sandi-1]
- Michael Hartl - [Enumerable for Fun & Profit][mike-1]
- Laura Frank - [Containerized Ruby Applications with Docker][laura-1]
- Aaron Patterson - [Keeping Ruby Weird][tenderlove-1]
- Aaron Patterson - [I've Made a Huge Mistake][tenderlove-2]
- Aaron Patterson - [Cat Care and Maintenance][tenderlove-3]
- Nickolas Means - [How to Code Like a Writer][nickolas-1]
- Katrina Owen - [Therapeutic Refactoring][katrina-1]
- Katrina Owen - [Here be Dragons][katrina-2]
- Katrina Owen - [Hacking Passiong][katrina-3]

Yes, that's a long list of talks. Keep in mind, for some of them, that was the second time I saw them. And I couldn't be happier about the time I've spent enthralled with the presented topics - it just makes me even happier to be part of this wonderful community.
