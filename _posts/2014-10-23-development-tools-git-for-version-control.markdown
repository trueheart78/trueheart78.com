There are times when I forget that the most important tools that I use nowadays are ones I absolutely take for granted. Ones that just become ingrained in my workflow, and seem effortless.

[Git][git] is one of those tools.

Version control is so important in development, and when you understand it, you have freedom. Freedom from wrecking a codebase. Freedom to try new things. Freedom to play.

If you're not quite sure where to get started, the [Pro Git][pro-git] book is freely available to read online. You don't need to read all of it, though. Get through chapter 3, and you'll hopefully understand it enough to start using it day-to-day.
