2015 is wrapping up soon, and I still have a few things
that I want to focus on so that I can start getting out a
few applications around the beginning of the year.

The following are things I will be spending time learning:

* The basics of using RSS feeds for audio.
* How to provide an RSS feed using a demo Rails app.
* Getting comfortable with Ajax in Rails.
* Integrating with PayPal at a deeper level than a form.
* Sending (and testing) emails using Rails' ActionMailer.
