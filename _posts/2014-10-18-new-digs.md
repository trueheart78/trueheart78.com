Decided it was high time to put together a real site (before, it was mainly just
a redirect to [my about.me page][aboutme]).

As I find myself with a desire to participate in community stuff, as well as
write up some blog posts, I figured it was important to move to a new system.

Some [new digs][skyfall-newdigs].

So I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll-rb] to manage the setup, and hosting it on
[GitHub pages][github-io].

Here's to a fresh start!
