I've been paid to write code since 2004. Most of that code has
been PHP. Some of that recent code has been Ruby.

Last year, I attended ZendCon. It's a large, annual PHP conference,
thrown by the good people at [Zend][zend]. I had a good time, met some
[great people][great-people]. But when this year came along, I didn't 
really want to go back. I wanted to try something new. Something 
different.

I decided I wanted to attend [RubyConf][rubyconf].

As someone that has spent most of their career working in PHP, and 
having only recently (over the past couple years) started to make Ruby
a part of my skillset, it would be fine to assume that I'm nervous.
And I kind of am.

But then I am reminded about what I love about development, and I
can't wait to get to learn more about the Ruby community first-hand
(I hear it's awesome).

If you're reading this, and you're attending, I really hope we get a 
chance to meet up. Just look for the guy who loves [business cat][business-cat]&mdash; I'll try to make it noticeable.
