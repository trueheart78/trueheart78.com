## [AJ Mendez Brooks][aj mendez]

> If you’re feeling lonely around the holidays, please consider me your drunk uncle who ruins dinner and falls asleep on the couch with his hand down his pants, I mean if it helps. - [October 2017 Highlights][aj oct 2017]

### [Kent Beck][kent beck]

> You're creating a vocabulary, not writing a program. Be a poet for a moment

### Ashe from FFXII

> I am simply myself. No more and no less.

### [Taylor Swift][taylor swift]

> No matter what you’ve gone through that makes you wish you hadn’t said that or wish you hadn’t done that, just give yourself a break. Please, for me, take it easy on yourself. It’s hard enough to live with what other people have to say. Please let the voices in your head be nice to you.
