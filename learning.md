## Timeline

### March 2025

* More studying on how do a wheelie on a motorcycle.
* Deep diving into Postgres and how it differs from MySQL.
  * I've managed MySQL servers before and this was overdue.
* Setup LLMs using [Ollama][ollama] and OpenWebUI on my PC.
  * WSL made this very easy. I love using Linux.

## Topics

### Motorcycling

* I run hot, so breathable gear makes the most sense.
* I **adore** sportier motorcycling. Give me a naked sport bike or sport bike over a standard or cruiser *any day*.
* I love the idea of adventure bikes and going off-road, but running hot limits that because my body temp rises swiftly.
