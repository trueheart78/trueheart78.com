1. There are three states of being:
   1. Not knowing. :dizzy_face:
   1. Action. :muscle:
   1. Completion. :metal:
1. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done. :crayon:
1. There is no editing stage. :hourglass:
1. Pretending you know what youâ€™re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just
   accept that you know what youâ€™re doing even if you donâ€™t and do it. :muscle:
1. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
   :rocket:
1. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done. :fire:
1. Once youâ€™re done you can throw it away. :wastebasket:
1. Laugh at perfection. Itâ€™s boring and keeps you from being done. :rofl: :gem:
1. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right. :fist_raised:
1. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes. :x: :skull_and_crossbones:
1. Destruction is a variant of done. :boom:
1. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done. :ghost:
1. Done is the engine of more. :racing_car:
