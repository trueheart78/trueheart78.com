> Programming shops are not universally happy. There’s a study about it, called “On the Unhappiness of Software Developers” (2017)

Talk is focused on _External_ so let’s wipe those.

The problem? **Other People!**

This is a problem of **Persuasion**.

## Being More Persuasive
Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert  Cialdini

1. Reciprocity
	1. Can easily be used against you (given a flower by a Hare Krishna meant they would guilt others into giving).
2. Consistency
	1. Strong internal desire to be consistent
	2. It’s why its easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than thinking your way into a new way of acting.
	3. If you start making people act in certain ways you can make people shift their own morality.
3. Social proof
	1. Will take the queue from others incase you aren’t sure what to do
	2. Fire alarm means you should leave, don’t wait on others. Needs someone to take action.
4. Authority
	1. We do what authorities say even when we don’t know
	2. We yield to their judgement
	3. There is uniform authority aka Police Officer
	4. There is expert authority aka TDD
5. Liking
	1. People that like you are more likely to do what you want
	2. Why does this exist? What purpose does it serve?
	3. We’re inclined to like people similar to us, and that we have previous positive experiences with
	4. It is linked to trust
	5. It goes back to reciprocity.
	6. Overly friendly people can make it feel like a deal you can’t/won’t fulfill
6. Scarcity
	1. Powerful motivation force
	2. Your waiting makes the scarce parking space take longer to open up, as it slows them down, even though they swear they are hurrying

Cialdini called the above _weapons of influence_ which can be a bad term. Being aware of them can be great, not being aware is a very potential problem.

## How to Win Friends & Influence People
Dale Carnegie

Fundamental point is _you can change others by changing yourself._

1. Make People Like You
	1. Become generally interested in other people
	2. Smile
	3. Remember that a person’s name is _to them_ the sweetest and most important sound _in any language_.
	4. Be a good listener.
	5. Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
	6. Make the other person feel important — and do it sincerely.
2. Handling People
	1. Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.
	2. Give honest and sincere appreciation
	3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.
3. Win people to your way of thinking
	1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it
	2. Show respect for the other person’s opinions (never say, “You’re wrong”)
	3. If **you** are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
	4. Begin in a friendly way.
	5. Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
	6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
	7. Let the other person feel that the idea is theirs
	8. Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view
	9. Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires
	10. Appeal to the nobler motives
	11. Dramatize your ideas
	12. Throw down a challenge
4. Be a Leader
	1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation
	2. Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly
	3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person
	4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
	5. Let the other person save face
	6. Praise the slightest improvement
	7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to
	8. Use encouragement
	9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

## Back to the Problem!
Remember, we’re unhappy with **other people**

![](You%20Are%20Insufficiently%20Persuasive%20by%20Sandi%20metz/E43CF3C2-22AA-40E9-A69E-E3012B758358.png)

If we could make them be different then we could be happy. Either through _weapons of influence_ or through changing yourself.

What if instead of assuming **you’re right** and instead assume that **you’re wrong**?

**How do you know you’re right?**

Ends vs Means. These will cause huge conflicts on teams.
Believe in each others good intentions

_Drive_ by Daniel H Pink finds money as an incentive for the type of work we do is less incentivizing
1. Autonomy 
	1. A powerful drive to choose how to do our work
2. Mastery
	1. We want to get good at stuff that has meaning only to us
3. Purpose
	1. We want work that matters.

> We crave for control of our lives, we yearn to get better at things, and we hunger for work that has meaning.  

If we desire the same ends than the issue is in the **understanding and collaboration**. It’s ok to be _influenced_. 

## How can we make better teams?
Project Aristotle - Google

Google found some things that don’t matter, like being same, levels of experience, etc.

Group norms seemed like it might matter, but they were different from group to group. Then came the _Emotional Intelligence of Groups_.

The one quality a team needed to be successful is how members treat one another.

> equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking  

> as long as everyone gets a chance to talk then the team did well.  

> average social sensitivity  
- being able to be able to pick up unspoken queues by other people is valuable here

**Psychological Safety**

That the team won’t embarrass or punish one for speaking up. ::The key thing that makes teams work::

## You
- You can have an identity but keep it small
- You can have strong opinions weakly held

What prevents us from trying to follow Carnegie’s rules?

You Are _not_ your code, your past, you parents, etc.

**Fear** keeps us from being open and vulnerable. It doesn’t matter, though, because ::You Are Good Enough::.

Put that burden down.

Caveat: some situations are so insane you should leave them.

If the trouble is communication-related at all, a good team can greatly benefit from you ::learning to be your best self::.
