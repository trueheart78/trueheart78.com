* Maintain the motivation until you are proficient

## Science says 3 different aspects are related to retaining motivation
* Subjective value
* Expectations of success
* Environment

1. Need a plan for reaching your goal
2. Believe the steps in your plan will work
3. Believe that you can perform those steps

> “When I first read the language spec, I knew all the words.”  

## Practice
> “Practice is neither work nor play. We don’t do it to be productive, and we don’t do it because its fun. If you are doing it right, it is almost never fun”  

> “Where your skill overlaps the challenge [..] is where you learn”  

> “Motivation relies on having a good plan”  

## Use `go doc`

```go
go doc os.Exit
```

```
func Exit(code int)
    Exit causes the current program to exit with the given status code.
    Conventionally, code zero indicates success, non-zero an error. The program
    terminates immediately; deferred functions are not run.
```

## Skill Develops When We Produce, Not Consume
