# Learning Go As My First Backend Language
[Audrey Lim - How a complete beginner learned Go as her first backend language in 5 weeks - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZh8uCInEfw)

## Roadblocks
- Dev setup
- Install problems
- Frameworks
- MVC Architecture (was just getting started)

## Common Advice
- RoR: Too much magic for a beginner
- Python: You donâ€™t need this to build websites!
- Node.js: JS is not for the backend!
- Go: It is too difficult for a beginner! It was designed for advanced programmers!

## Go 1.3
- Easy install
- No frameworks
- Libs seemed solid enough exposure to CS concepts
- Simplicity, liberty, focus

## Go is a Fantastic Teaching Tool
1. Syntax
	- Assisted with learning about runes
2. Mini Challenges
	- Found on Go Tour and helped build confidence

## Go Helps Shape Your Imagination
- Go felt like it gave you LEGO bricks to work with regarding the package system

## Single Rule
1. Clear conventions
2. Usually only one way to do one thing
3. Without worrying too much about syntax issues, frees up your imagination to build whatever you want with very powerful tools
