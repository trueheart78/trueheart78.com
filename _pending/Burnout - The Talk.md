# Burnout - The Talk?
* Two clear separations in my professional life, before and after burnout
* Looking at everything that happened before it, it’s easy to see that so much contributed to it.
* I was a senior developer
* I was in charge of a large codebase for nearly 8 years
* Thinking back to those times, though, it makes me not want to even talk about it, cuz I start to feel nauseated 

## What Does Burnout Feel Like?
As a developer, it felt like my brain was actively rejecting any sort of development-based task. I couldn’t program in PHP, which was my OTP.

Dig at PHP all you want, it paid the bills for over a decade. It’s time had honestly come. Serious programming just wasn’t happening. I would just sit there, in front of my computer, with my editor open, and ready to tackle the problem and just... couldn’t. My brain felt like it was coated in molasses. I often say it was like trying to slam my head against a brick wall, but instead, it was padded. Progress just was not mine. 

This didn’t mean I couldn’t program, because I’d been learning Ruby slowly over those past few years. It doesn’t make complete sense to me, either, but I attribute it to the Ruby community and my goal of finding joy in it. PHP was something I needed to move on from, like an old language I could read, but writing just wasn’t easy anymore.

It stole my joy. I couldn’t find it there anymore. 

## When Does Burnout End?
I’m honestly not sure it does. I guess for some people, it might just "go away". I talked to a manager (with zero dev experience) of mine during that time and they told me, "This is my second time of feeling burned out. I’m just going through the motions until it goes away, like I did last time." 

Years later, I still struggled to write PHP code. I have thankfully moved on from any codebase that requires it.

## How To Escape Burnout
I like this header a lot, because burnout did feel like a prison. I felt stuck, and restricted, and unable to be part of my own daily life that I’d grown used to. 

For me, escaping meant moving on to something else, job-wise. 

It was time to move on. I did not have the patience, the mental stability, or the wherewithal to wait it out. A decade of programming experience and adoration for the Ruby language and surrounding community meant I could still accomplish something, even if I never touched that now poisoned language again.

## What Did Help Me?
// does this tie into the above notes?
// do Katrina and Dave need to be mentioned?
// definitely will plug CMM

## Hindsight - What Could Have Helped Me?

* A mentor, or at least someone to talk to about it that didn’t basically tell me (without any words) they had no idea how to deal with it.
* A manager that did not basically tell me their solution was to just "get through it", however miserable it made them.
