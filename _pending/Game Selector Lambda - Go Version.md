# Game Selector Lambda - Go Version
I have a crazy cool game selector built in Ruby running on Sinatra and being hosted on Heroku.

Iâ€™d love to transition this to an AWS Lambda-based binary, written in Go, using the AWS API Gateway for interfacing.

The current version does have tests, so they should be handy in making it act identically.

## Code
[GitHub - trueheart78/game-selector: Parses my game list and returns whatever I want it to](https://github.com/trueheart78/game-selector/)

## Technologies
- Redis
	- Caches the parsed page so frequent requests have no extra page requests. *May be unnecessary*
	- Caching  for N minutes (5-10) 
	- *v1.0 may not have this*
	- https://golangme.com/blog/how-to-use-redis-with-golang/
	- Use AWS Elasticache Redis
