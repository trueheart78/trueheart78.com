<a name='why'>

## :thought_balloon: Why?

_"You should be playing games you enjoy. Just remember your pile when you start
looking for something else to play, instead of purchasing another title. That's
really all this is for - to make sure you enjoy what you're playing and getting
rid of stuff that you aren't."_ - Me

## :memo: Notes to Self

+ I should not buy DLC until I am ready to play it.
+ I stop playing open world games when I complete the main story.
+ I am bad at platformers, regardless of how much I enjoy watching them.
  - See _Super Lucky's Tale_ and _Mario Maker 2_.
+ I am much more of a taste-tester than I ever was before. This leads to more jettisoned games, but
  in the end I, I find myself playing more games and getting hooked on the ones that really click
  with me.
