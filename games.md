_"You should be playing games you enjoy. Just remember your pile when you start
looking for something else to play, instead of purchasing another title. That's
really all this is for - to make sure you enjoy what you're playing and getting
rid of stuff that you aren't."_ - Me

     favorite game I've played in 2017.
1. Nioh (PS4)

   + Feels like a solid C+ / B-
1. Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS4)

   + Framerate on the Pro was rough.
   + Feels like a C.

#### Jettisoned

1. Axiom Verge (PS4/Vita)

   - Just not enjoying it.

   - Love the style, but after nearly 10 hours, still can't be
    the first boss. If rebalanced, will consider returning to it.
1. Persona 1 (PSP/Vita)
   - I get what they were going for, and after about 10 hours, I'm good.
1. The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone DLC (PS4)
   - I will never get to the Witcher 3 DLCs.
