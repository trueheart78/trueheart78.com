_"You should be playing games you enjoy. Just remember your pile when you start
looking for something else to play, instead of purchasing another title. That's
really all this is for - to make sure you enjoy what you're playing and getting
rid of stuff that you aren't."_ - Me

#### Jettisoned

  - It's hard to go back to those controls.
1. The Witness (PS4)
  - Very good, but moved on.
1. Dragon Age Inquisition DLC: Trespasser (PS4)
  - So hard to get back into this game again, skills- and controls-wise.
