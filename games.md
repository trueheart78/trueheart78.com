   * May revisit after the next-gen upgrade, but not before.
   * Judy :sparkling_heart:
   * Panam :sparkling_heart:
1. Watch Dogs: Legion (XSX) <!-- Nov 2020 -->
   * On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6.5 (Decent).
   * No main character made the game less engaging.
   * Story beats were solid.
   * Really chuffed it lost 6 hours of progress due to an autosave issue.
   * I did enjoy the hacking and bits, but for me, even with all the crashes and bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 ate its lunch and dinner and kept me overnight and took me out to breakfast. 
   * Bagley :sparkling_heart:
1. Sayonara Wild Hearts (NS) <!-- Oct 2019 -->
   * Chose this as a palette cleanser and it delivered in spades.
   * The entire experience was simply wonderful.
   * I don't think I could recommend this game highly enough.
   * I had a tear running down my cheek by the end of the game.
   * Best end level I have played in a long time. :kiss:
1. Project TRIANGLE STRATEGYâ„¢ (working title) Debut Demo (NS)
   * Played enough of the demo to know I like it.
   * Reminds me of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, strategy-wise.
   * Looks like OCTOPATH TRAVELER
   * Will defintely consider this on-sale, post-release.
1. Rain on Your Parade (XB1) :green_heart: <!-- May -->
   * Wonderful game that didn't overstay it's welcome.
   * Continually changed up the formula.
   * Literally laughed out loud at a late game achievement. 
   * Cloudy :sparkling_heart:
1. Tunic Demo (XSX) <!-- June -->
   * Fun and charming.
   * Impeccable music.
1. Haven (XSX) :green_heart:
   * It had me at, _"Hello"_ [(the _New Game_ screen)][haven - new game]. :cupid:
   * "This is wonderful", I said aloud, in the nest for the first time. :heartpulse:
   * Just caught myself smiling at [the interactions][haven - butt] between [Kay & Yu][haven - criminal lovers]. :revolving_hearts:
   * [I love this][haven - selfie]. I didnâ€™t know a game [like this][haven - embrace] existed. :blush:
1. Chicory: A Colorful Tale (PS4) <!-- June -->
   * Completely worth the price of admission.
   * Very enjoyable gameplay.
   * Godmode and Boss Skip options should be standards.
   * Very solid story covering emotions and friendship.
   * Chicory :sparkling_heart:
1. Subsurface Circular (NS) [2.5hr] <!-- July -->
   * Mixed feelings. 
   * Did like the lore nod to Thomas Was Alone. :heart:

<a id='why'></a>

## :thought_balloon: Why? [:top:][top]

> You should be playing games you enjoy. Just remember your pile when you start
> looking for something else to play, instead of purchasing another title.
>
> That's really all this is for - to make sure you enjoy what you're playing and getting rid of
> stuff that you aren't. - [Me, 2013][2013 - 12 month pile thread GWJ]

<a id='notes-to-self'></a>

## :memo: Notes to Self [:top:][top]

+ I should not buy DLC until I am ready to play it.
+ I stop playing open world games when I complete the main story.
+ I am bad at platformers, regardless of how much I enjoy watching them.
  - See _Super Lucky's Tale_ and _Mario Maker 2_.
+ I am much more of a taste-tester than I ever was before. This leads to more jettisoned games, but
  in the end I, I find myself playing more games and getting hooked on the ones that really click
  with me.
