## :checkered_flag: Beaten

1. Shakedown: Hawaii (NS)
   * A fun, overhead-style GTA game that doesn't take itself too seriously.
1. Katana Zero (NS)
   * Really enjoyed the style (music, colors, VHS, etc).
   * Combat was very fun.
   * Story was quite intriguing.
   * Very few dull moments.
1. Zelda: Link's Awakening (NS)
   * Beat on standard and hard mode.
   * Fun, but more obtuse than what I expected (see Eagle Tower).
   * Overall, a good time, but would have preferred a sale.
1. Neo Cab (NS)
   * Interesting concept.
   * Endings were not strong.
1. Trine: Enchanted Edition (NS)
   * Enjoyed a decent amount.
1. Fire Emblem: Three Houses (NS)
   * Spent 164 hours across three play throughs.
   * Adored the interactions with support characters.
   * Enjoyed it so much I upgraded my Switch for better battery life.
1. Star Wars: Jedi - Fallen Order (PS4)
   * A throwback to the good lightsaber fighting games of old.
   * A fantastic story told quite well.
   * New cannonical characters that I hope to see more of (Merrin, mainly).
   * An enjoyable skill tree that didn't feel limiting.
   * Lots of exploration.

<a name='why'>

## :thought_balloon: Why?

_"You should be playing games you enjoy. Just remember your pile when you start
looking for something else to play, instead of purchasing another title. That's
really all this is for - to make sure you enjoy what you're playing and getting
rid of stuff that you aren't."_ - Me

## :memo: Notes to Self

+ I should not buy DLC until I am ready to play it.
+ I stop playing open world games when I complete the main story.
