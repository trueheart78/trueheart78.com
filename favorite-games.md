### :trophy: Haven (XSX) :trophy: **Game of the Year** :trophy:

![Haven - Kay and Yu][haven]

Haven. Wow. Where to begin. Let me start of by saying that I had no idea a game [like this][haven - embrace] existed. It had me [from the jump (the _New Game_ screen)][haven - new game]. A game about an
existing romance that I get to tag along for, and watch grow? I was all in!

From the inside of Kay & Yu's home, the Nest, through the trials and tribulations of exploring a
foreign planet and doubling down on love, Haven brought me a lot of smiles. Watching their relationship
grow closer and closer through [light-hearted interactions][haven - butt] and [while camping out][haven - criminal lovers],
to [more intimate][haven - in bed] scenes. Also, sometimes, [it's just about needing snuggles][haven - snuggles].

I just loved it so much. So, so much. :revolving_hearts:

### :trophy: Cyberpunk 2077 (XSX) :trophy: **Game of the Year** :trophy:

![Cyberpunk 2077 - Female V][cyberpunk-2077]

Yes, Cyberpunk 2077. The bug-ridden, frequently crashing, and "runs like trash on last gen
consoles" game. That, but played on an Xbox Series X in glorious 4K, won me over. Let's be honest,
though, short of playing it on a decent PC, I had the best system to run it on. The new console made
this game enjoyable, as bugs became a nuisance and not an issue. I made the mistake of pre-ordering
it, but waited until the second patch to start it up. I also avoided all the vitriol surrounding
it's lackluster release.

By the time I was done in Night City, I was 92 hours in. I once had over a million eddies. I even
allied with two of the best NPCs in the game. Was it cool having Keanu Reeves kicking about in my
head? Definitely. However, when I look back on this game, and yearn to return to it when the
next-gen patches are out, I don't think of Johnny Silverhand, or of Rogue. I think of Judy. I think
of Panam. I think of Night City and how much I just want to go roam those streets and run jobs
again; And I haven't even mentioned Brain Dances... I'm still amazed it made it into the final game,
and I am _**still**_ impressed with it.

## :scroll: Game of the Year - 2019 [:top:][page-top]

### :trophy: Fire Emblem: Three Houses (NS) :trophy: **Game of the Year** :trophy:

![Fire Emblem - All Three Leaders][fe3h-all-3]

Rarely does a game come out that I have zero anticipation for that captures my attention as quickly
as Three Houses did. It came out, I knew little about it, but I was enticed enough to purchase
it digitally, and after 165 hours across 3 of the storylines, I can say without a doubt that it
was my favorite game of the year.

This was a game that made me want to upgrade my console when the revised Switch with better
battery life was announced, because I could barely get 2 hours in handheld mode. It bumped up
to over 4 hours after the upgrade and I don't regret it one bit.

<a id='goty-2018'></a>

## :scroll: Game of the Year - 2018 [:top:][page-top]

Much like [last year][goty-2017], I'm going with a single standout title. I've also got some awards
for many other games, except for those I considered personal disappointments.

### :trophy: Assassin's Creed Odyssey (PS4) :trophy: **Game of the Year** :trophy:

![Assassin's Creed Odyssey - Kassandra][ac-odyssey-kassandra]

I really didn't expect this to end up as the game to define my year. Until recently, with
the wonderful Origins entry, this series was completely off my radar. In a year where I
played Origins and then months later went on to play Odyssey, you'd think my combined time
with them would have worn me out. That I would have been beaten down by the weight of
Ubisoft's stabby franchise. This is, after all, the eleventh main game in the series.

However, Origins was a wonderful reboot, and Odyssey just took it even further. A huge map,
an interesting backstory, and a character that just excels at taking down everything. Changing things
up might as well be the name of the game, and I loved the fact that I could stealthily take down
an entire fort, wade into a battlefield and fight multiple enemies at once, or snipe camp after camp.

They also spent a lot of time making sure to not overdue the whole Greek monsters aspect. I didn't
even realize they were in the game until I encountered my first one, and each of them that I fought
felt like they were done with respect and not just to create another boss battle.

I spent 85 hours in this game, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Kassandra was a
delight to play, and I will be picking it up again. I rarely, if ever, want to continue an open-world
game once I've completed the main story, and that speaks volumes.

## :scroll: Game of the Year - 2017 [:top:][page-top]

This year, there was a single game that stood out amongst the rest. Instead of going through a traditional "Top 10" list,
I have decided instead to single out the Game of the Year and then present awards for different games, if I found them
deserving enough. It should give you a bit of insight into how I feel about them.

### :trophy: Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS4) :trophy: **Game of the Year** :trophy:

![Horizon Zero Dawn - Aloy vs Thunderjaw][hzd-aloy-thunderjaw]

I couldn't get this game out of my head all year long. When I learned the backstory post-Deathbringer, I felt sick.
Further in, the reveal of what "Zero Dawn" was pretty frickinâ€™ awesome. The ending gave me the feels. It got dusty, for sure.
Even after 240+ hours in Breath of the Wild, this is still my favorite game from 2017.

<a id='goty-2016'></a>

### :scroll: Game of the Year - 2016 [:top:][page-top]

### 1. Hitman (PS4)

I always wanted to love this series, but it wasn't until this most recent release
that it could be realized. Thanks to Giantbomb's coverage of this exceptional
game, I learned to love the mistake-ridden mayhem (let me be clear: the mistakes
are all mine). I have hit max mastery in each level, and know them all by heart.

Hitman doesn't take itself seriously, and each destination is a playground. Every
map is somebody else's favortie. And maps that I weren't too keen on originally
would grow on me once I became familiar with them. This became essential when I
started doing Elusive Targets, because you only get one chance to get in, take
them out, and get out. Oh, and you can't save.

I remember introducing my nephew to this game. As a shooter fanatic, he was so bad
it was hilarious. His penchant for guns got him in more trouble, and it was
awesome. I remember the first time I picked up a cannon ball in Sapienza. The way
he laughed when I threw it at an npc's face will stay with me forever.

### 2. Dark Souls III (PS4)

The Souls series has always been something I have watched from a distance. I've
never considered myself a fan of the difficulty. Well, not until 2016.

Dark Souls III was my first Souls game. I saw it being streamed a lot on Twitch,
and it wasn't until a week after it came out that the itch began. A quick rental
was followed by a purchase. And then, it got its hooks in me.

I can count on one hand the number of games I have replayed because I find them
challenging. "Man, that was fun. Let's do it again, this time, with _[insert
self-imposed restriction]_." It wasn't helping that I was watching people attempt
to do no-hit runs. While watching them was fun, I decided armorless runs were for
me. 

So, for the first time in ages, I was replaying a game because the challenge was
rewarding. And the boss I struggled with the most was the Twin Princes, regardless
of the type of run. So enjoy my favorite highlight:

<iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwwKBSCZ8C0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### 3. Watch_Dogs 2 (PS4)

I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Watch_Dogs 2. I stayed far away from the
first game after hearing the lackluster response. Imagine my surprise when I was
captivated with the sequel. An open world game where dealing with the environment
and its denizens requires use of gadgets (and scissor lifts)!? Sign me up!

The side characters each had interesting stories, and the hacks that you get to
perform with alongside them made me smile so very big. From remote-controlling cars,
to destroying voting machines to the tune of _Fortunate Son_, to hacking into
satellite systems and using those to perform remote hacks, it doesn't let up.

### 4. Stardew Valley (PC & PS4)

What a whirlwind adventure I had with Stardew Valley. Over 150 hours spent in it
between the PC and PS4 version, and it's something else.

Charming music, interesting villagers, and crop-growing mechanic that eventually
proves quite lucrative. Oh, and did I mention exploring the caves?

I love the art style, and just the overall flavor of the game. The fact that this
was the work of a single developer is pretty crazy. I enjoyed every part. Well,
every part of the first 7 months. Winter of year 2 can become a slog, and that's
where both of my playthroughs floundered. But man, what an amazing 7 months.

### 5. DOOM (PS4)

DOOM was a great game. From the guns to the glory kills, to just all-out room
battles. I caught myself smiling more than once, especially towards the conclusion.
This was definitely the game I heard the most about before I played it, and it
held up to the hype.

I really liked the assortment of weapons. I generally am not the craziest FPS
player, but I like what I like, and the choices here felt really fleshed out. I
had to laugh, though, when I picked up the Super Shotgun (a sawed-off shotgun),
because I knew I was in for some fun. It became my main choice for nearly every
non-boss baddie.

The level design was pretty good, overall. The differing vistas of Mars and Hell
never felt old, or overstayed their welcome. They were tied together quite well,
and the story (yes, the story in a single-player FPS) was actually quite good.
From the backstory of the DOOM Slayer told from the perspective of demons, to the
desire of infinite energy for mankind, it was quite intriguing. Especially the
player character's complete lack of care for anything that didn't involve violence.

### 6. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (PS4)

I didn't like Geralt until I saw his interactions with Ciri. And then he made more
sense to me. The fact that this game is on my list comes down to two reasons:
Yenefer and Ciri.

<a id='all-time'></a>

## Of All Time [:top:][page-top]

<a id='ffvi'></a>

### 1. Final Fantasy VI (SNES)

_To be written._

<a id='persona-4'></a>

### 2. Persona 4 Golden (Vita)

**The only game I've ever wanted to hug.**

One of my favorite things about playing Final Fantasy VI back in the day was that
it didn't stray from adult topics. Persona 4 Golden is the first game since then
that I can remember tackling some similar issues. Memory loss, the price of fame,
identity troubles, unfulfilled crushes, and even cross-dressing, are all addressed
with this small, wonderful package.

I say small, but this game easily spans 60+ hours. And it has ample VO, to boot.
It's refreshing to play a game like this.

Combat-wise, it allows you to micro-manage your teammates to the level you desire.
Want them to focus on support and healing, or damage, or just want to give them
orders yourself? And the tactics you set actually make the characters feel more
alive. I'd only take control when a party member absolutely needed to do something
and I hadn't been convinced by the AI enough to trust them. And to be fair, I
think that happened once in my entire playthrough.

I should mention the story, too. It contains mystery behind mystery, and takes
some turns I did not see coming _at all_. I've laughed out loud many times at it,
as well. The characters all have such great personalities, and are very much their
own individuals.

I can say I was honestly surprised that a game originally released in 2008 that
I never got to until 2017 would jump into second place on my favorite games of all
time list, but here we are. And I think it deserves this spot, without question.

### 3. Road Rash (PS1/Gen/Win)

This is such wonderful game. It's been so long since I've played it. I remember spending
so much time with this at my cousin's house when I was young. When I was in my 20's, I had
it on PC and it was still great. Recently (late 2018), I bought the PS1 version to play on
my PS3 and it has been a joy just getting back into it.

This game does so many things right, and (save for the Genesis version) even has some
great FMV. The intro made me tear up, and I say that with pride. I've always adored this
game and am thrilled to put it on this list.

Here's a taste of the goodness that is the intro video.

<iframe width="680" height="408" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBdlScU7N6M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<a id='horizon-zero-dawn'></a>

### Horizon: Zero Dawn

![Horizon Zero Dawn - Aloy Scouting][hzd-aloy-scouting]

Not quite sure where this game goes on my overall list of favorites ever. For a
2017 game though, it's going to take a lot to challenge it for GotY. Oh yeah, and
it's only March...

My bullet points, until I get to writing up something more proper:

+ Love the stealth / noise mechanic.
+ The World is so great.
  + Love the scope of the world.
  + Barely used mounts because the world was just fun to explore.
+ Love the machine variety.
  + Really loved the snapmaws when I discovered them.
  + Fighting machines rarely got old.
  + It felt like fighting dinosaurs.
+ Love when battles go crazy and you are just scrambling to win.
+ Love the range of weapon features.
  + upgrade paths unlock new elemental damage.
+ Armor is interesting.
  + Stealth armor is cool.
  + Enjoy the selection and the designs.
  + Would like an easier way to switch armors.
+ Music is wonderful
+ Story-wise:
  + When I learned the backstory post-Deathbringer, I felt sick.
  + The idea of "Zero Dawn" is pretty frickinâ€™ awesome.
  + The ending gave me the feels. It got dusty, for sure.
+ Ashly Burch killed it as Aloy.
+ Lance Reddick was a great addition.
+ Strong women throughout the game.
