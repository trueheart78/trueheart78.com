## What is a Tone Indicator?

**Tone indicators are shorthand for words used to convey tone**, which the Cambridge Dictionary
defines as _"a quality in the voice that expresses the speaker's feelings or thoughts"_.

The tone of someone's voice can be joking, or serious; it can be teasing, or threatening. It can
be negative, positive, or neutral. It can be sexually suggestive, or entirely friendly. **Tone can
do so much to change the meaning and implications of a sentence.**

Some examples of tone indicators are **"/j", "/s", "/srs", "/p", "/r", "/ly", "neg", "pos", "/gen"
and "/c"**. Though there are many others, these are the ones that are most commonly used and needed
for clarity of communication.

The intended use of tone indicators is in text, and they are prevalent on social media where
**miscommunication is rife, and posts and messages are often misinterpreted.**
