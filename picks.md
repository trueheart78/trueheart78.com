August 13th, 2016:

- [Heroku][heroku-site]:
  - Simple to host on, and I don't have to worry about managing everything.
  - [Rails Setup][heroku-rails-setup] because we all forget things.
  - [Rails Quick Setup][heroku-rails-quick-setup] for those that don't.
- [WebSequenceDiagrams.com][wsd-site] for a good sequence diagrams app.
- [Jesse Storimer][jesse-storimer-site] has authored 3 books, of which I
  am in the process of studying. Wonderful stuff for those interested in
  learning more about computers and how Ruby works with it.

- [Upcase][upcase-site]:
A wonderful online finishing school. Their tagline is, "Let's get that *junior*
out of your title". Well worth the $30 a month - your employer may even cover it,
just ask! **Link includes 50% off your first month**
- [Exercises for Programmers][exercises-for-programmers]:
Working through this as part of a dev book club, and the exercises can seem very
simple. However, a slight change of approach and you can end up spending 8 hours
building a game for one of them, like I did.
- [Supergirl Pilot Episode][supergirl-cbs-site]:
A delightful introduction to a female superhero that is current, quirky, and
just plain delightful. It's rare that I watch much television, so it's nice to
be surprised by the care and quality in the first episode.

October 18th, 2014:

- [CodeNewbie][code-newbie-website]:
a great place for those just getting starting in any area of development.
- Saron Yitbarek [[twitter][saron-yitbarek-twitter]] [[site][saron-yitbarek-site]]:
Inspiring the aspiring developers out there, and helping to create a community of
communication and comraderie. A breath of fresh air, you should really check out
her stuff.
- [Real Favicon Generator.net][real-favicon-generator]:
Great for helping to get your favicon setup properly on your site, and also helps
understand mobile supprt.
- Ben Orenstein [[twitter][ben-orenstein-twitter]] [[site][ben-orenstein-site]]:
His love for Vim and his desire to remove the friction from his everyday tool usage
is just what I needed. Also, dude gives great talks. Like, seriously, great talks.
