Shamelessy stealing this idea from the fantastic [Ruby Rogues podcast][ruby-rogues-podcast]
- consider them the first pick :)

- [CodeNewbie][code-newbie-website]: a great place for those just getting starting
in any area of development.
- Saron Yitbarek [[twitter][saron-yitbarek-twitter]] [[site][saron-yitbarek-site]]:
A breath of fresh air, you should really check out her stuff.
- [Real Favicon Generator.net][real-favicon-generator]: Great for helping to get your
favicon setup properly on your site, and also helps understand mobile supprt.
