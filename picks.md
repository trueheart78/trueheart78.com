Shamelessy stealing this idea from the fantastic [Ruby Rogues podcast][ruby-rogues-podcast]
- consider them the first pick :)

October 27, 2015:

- [Upcase][upcase-site]:
A wonderful online finishing school. Their tagline is, "Let's get that *junior*
out of your title". Well worth the $30 a month - your employer may even cover it,
just ask! **Link includes 50% off your first month**
- [Exercises for Programmers][exercises-for-programmers]:
Working through this as part of a dev book club, and the exercises can seem very
simple. However, a slight change of approach and you can end up spending 8 hours
building a game for one of them, like I did.
- [Supergirl Pilot Episode][supergirl-cbs-site]:
A delightful introduction to a female superhero that is current, quirky, and
just plain delightful. It's rare that I watch much television, so it's nice to
be surprised by the care and quality in the first episode.

- [CodeNewbie][code-newbie-website]:
a great place for those just getting starting in any area of development.
- Saron Yitbarek [[twitter][saron-yitbarek-twitter]] [[site][saron-yitbarek-site]]:
Inspiring the aspiring developers out there, and helping to create a community of
communication and comraderie. A breath of fresh air, you should really check out
her stuff.
- [Real Favicon Generator.net][real-favicon-generator]:
Great for helping to get your favicon setup properly on your site, and also helps
understand mobile supprt.
- Ben Orenstein [[twitter][ben-orenstein-twitter]] [[site][ben-orenstein-site]]:
His love for Vim and his desire to remove the friction from his everyday tool usage
is just what I needed. Also, dude gives great talks. Like, seriously, great talks.
