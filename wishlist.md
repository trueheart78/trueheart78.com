## About

Josh is a software developer that loves programming in Ruby and listening to Taylor Swift. He also enjoys the odd comic (Squirrel Girl, Gwenpool, Captain Marvel, etc), especially anything illustrated by Gurihiru, Jen Bartel, and Skottie Young.

He's not a big fan of art books, or books in general. His audio book list is around 100 titles, and probably 5% of that he's listened to, so those are out, as well.

He's also not much for sports. He deals with depression and anxiety, and one of the few ways he enjoys himself is on his motorcycle, fully geared up and trying not to do stupid things on his Kawasaki Ninja 400 ABS (Persimmon Red). His need for anything motorcycle-related is non-existent, but the joy it brings him, well, that's worth noting.

He does love video games. Right now, Xbox is his preferred platform (his beautiful, gorgeous, adoring and caring wife got him a Series X for his 42nd birthday in 2020). New controllers are always a delight, because he's got way too many games. He's also adoring the Shock Blue controller because it's dope (thanks Mr. Freeze)! If you think he doesn't have enough games, there's about 60 installed on his Xbox right now, and Game Pass just keeps giving him more.

He also owns a PS4 Pro (with no plans to upgrade to a PS5, as he doesn't much care for Sony first-party games), a Nintendo Switch (something he doesn't use often, unless he's starting a new farm in Stardew Valley), and an Oculus Quest 2 (with like, all the accessories. Like, all of them. Even prescription lenses).

So choose wisely! If an item is on this list, it's probably because he can't justify the cost or need. They are literal wants, not needs.

Use the given information wisely.
