![Taylor Swift - Hello][taylor-hi]

I love writing Ruby & Go :sparkling_heart:, rocking out to Taylor Swift :notes:, and using gifs to

### :globe_with_meridians: I :sparkling_heart: Ruby

My personal website that also includes a [slightly active blog][blog]. Like any good personal site,
it is host to many different [pages][pages]. Utilizes [Jekyll][jekyll] so I only have to use markdown,
and is hosted on [GitHub pages][github-pages].

* Site: [iheartruby.com][iheartruby]
* Source: [GitHub][iheartruby-source]

### :link: Dropbox Gif Linker

I have a lot of gifs in my Dropbox, so I wanted a simpler way to get a publicly viewable URL. It
connects to Dropbox‚Äôs api and creates a public share, caches that in a key-value store (in said
Dropbox), and provides an embeddable URL. Great for markdown and BBCode support.

Originally written in Ruby, now written in Go.

* Go Source: [GitHub][dropbox-gif-linker-source]
* Ruby Source: [GitHub][gifs-gem-source]

### :golf: Caring for Karen Sue

A charity-focused site that holds annual golf-based events, built in Ruby using Rails. Uses PayPal
for payment processing. 

* Site: [caringforkarensue.com][caringforkarensue]
* Source: [GitHub][caringforkarensue-source]

### :notebook: Book Notes

Where I put notes from books I‚Äôve read. Makes it much easier to study across machines, and provides
a handy, searchable reference.

* Source: [GitHub][book-notes-source]

### :repeat: Book Notes Generator 

Extracted from the early version of my Book Notes, it reads a YAML file and generates the core the
core markdown files for the chapters and sections. It also places them directly into the above Book
Notes project in a new folder, with a handy Readme link provided at the end. _I should really change
this into a gem or a binary_.

* Source: [GitHub][book-notes-generator-source]

### :skull: Dead To Us

A goof project to display team members at CMM that are "dead to us" (read: anyone that has left the
team). Originally a Rails 5 project, I converted it to a basic HTML site on AWS S3 for faster load
times, and no monthly cost.

* Site: [deadtous.com][dead-to-us]
* Source: [GitHub][dead-to-us-source]

### :video_game: Go, Deathbonus!

As someone that enjoys watching people play games on [Twitch][twitch] (and generally does so from
a mobile device), I wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use site that could take me to a streamer's
subscribe page, their chat in a browser window, or directly to their stream. So, as [Dexbonus][dexbonus]
is one of my favorite content creators, I created a basic website using an alias of theirs, crafted
it as a JavaScript-powered HTML page, and hosted it on AWS S3.

* Site: [go.deathbon.us][deathbonus]
* Source: [GitHub][deathbonus-source]

### :rotating_light: Go! Call Me (Maybe)!

Originally a Sinatra-based Ruby application called _Alexa Alerter_, I converted this into a Go-based
binary that works with Twilio and can be uploaded to the AWS Lambda service, with environment
variables controlling some of the features. It then can have an Alexa-based skill pointed towards it,
enabling features like, "tell Josh I need him".

* Ruby Source: [GitHub][alexa-alerter-source]

### ü¶† Global Pandemic Goofs

This abomination of a website was created because of the absurdness of the global pandemic. At one
point, this pandemic will pass, and then this site will be useless, so we goof on it while we can. It
is a Ruby application utilizing Sinatra and has weighted logic to select random elements that make
up the phrases. It reads from text files to provide options to replace the phrase, "In this global
pandemic?", with something like, "In this gleaming pop concert hall?", or "In this gothic Pulp Juice
And Smoothie Bar?" It even has a simple, but effective, API.

### :watermelon: Food Tracker

A personalized Ruby application with the Sinatra framework that displays what we have to eat. Uses
YAML files to store data, so that it can be edited on-the-go (no database interface required).

## :octocat: Open Source Contributions [:top:][top]

![Taylor Swift - Absolutely Epic][taylor-epic]

### :cat: Kitty

Migrated to a cross-platform terminal emulator called [kitty][kitty] and realized it did not support
the default Emoji keyboard on MacOS. Submitted a PR which added the missing support, and
(although the PR was closed), it was addressed minutes later in a new commit by the maintainer,
with a reference included.

* Pull Request: [GitHub][kitty-pr]
* Commit: [GitHub][kitty-commit]

### :zap: Turbolinks

Discovered an IE8-related bug in Turbolinks and submitted a PR to the project. It was merged later that same day.

* Pull request: [GitHub][turbolinks-pr]

### :traffic_light: Stoplight Admin

Found two bugs in the project related to a previous user's PR. One related to support for the Redis
version dependency being increased when it made no sense, the other related to missing library
support for `sinatra/json`. Not only were both the bugs fixed, but I also introduced tests into the
project to make sure that at least the core framework would load without issue.

* Redis Pull Request: [GitHub][stoplight-redis-pr]
* Tests Pull Request: [GitHub][stoplight-tests-pr]
