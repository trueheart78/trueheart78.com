![Taylor Swift - Hello][taylor-hi]

I love writing Ruby & Go :sparkling_heart:, rocking out to Taylor Swift :notes:, and using gifs and

I've been writing software professionally since 2004, with a strong lean towards back-end development.

I enjoy lighthearted, collaborative teams, that I can learn from.

![Taylor Swift - Award Dance][taylor-award-dance]

<!-- TODO: Try to limit this to 10 or less. You can always find discarded entries in the git history. -->

### :globe_with_meridians: I :sparkling_heart: Ruby

My personal website that also includes a [slightly active blog][blog]. Like any good personal site,
it is host to many different [pages][pages]. Utilizes [Jekyll][jekyll] so I only have to use markdown,
and is hosted on [Netlify][netlify].

* Site: [trueheart78.com][trueheart78-site] aka [iheartruby.com][iheartruby]
* Source: [GitHub][iheartruby-source]

### :link: Dropbox Gif Linker

I have a lot of gifs in my [Dropbox][dropbox], so I wanted a simpler way to get a publicly viewable
URL. It connects to Dropbox‚Äôs API and creates a public share, caches that in a key-value store (in
said Dropbox), and provides an embeddable URL. Great for markdown and BBCode support.

Originally written in Ruby, now written in Go.

* Go Source: [GitHub][dropbox-gif-linker-source]
* Ruby Source: [GitHub][gifs-gem-source]

### :golf: Caring for Karen Sue

A charity-focused site that holds annual golf-based events, built in Ruby using Rails. Uses PayPal
for payment processing. 

* Site: [caringforkarensue.com][caringforkarensue]
* Source: [GitHub][caringforkarensue-source]

### :detective: Gem Lookup

Simple but effective command line tool that looks up gem details using [RubyGems.org's public API][ruby-gems-api] and displays the results in an emoji-filled format. Makes concurrent requests and obeys the rate limit via a  batching feature.

* RubyGems: [Gem Lookup][gem-lookup-ruby-gems]
* Source: [GitHub][gem-lookup-source]

### :notebook: Book Notes

Where I put notes from books I‚Äôve read. Makes it much easier to study across machines, and provides
a handy, searchable reference.

* Source: [GitHub][book-notes-source]

### :repeat: Book Notes Generator 

Extracted from the early version of my [Book Notes][book-notes-source], it reads a YAML file and
generates the core markdown files for the chapters and sections. It also places them directly into
the above Book Notes project in a new folder, with a handy Readme link provided at the end. 

* Source: [GitHub][book-notes-generator-source]

### :space_invader: Go, Deathbonus!

As someone that enjoys watching people play games on [Twitch][twitch] (and generally does so from
a mobile device), I wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use site that could take me to a streamer's
subscribe page, their chat in a browser window, or directly to their stream. So, as [Dexbonus][dexbonus]
is one of my favorite content creators, I created a basic website using an alias of theirs, crafted
it as a JavaScript-powered HTML page, and hosted it on [Netlify][netlify].

* Site: [go.deathbon.us][deathbonus]
* Source: [GitHub][deathbonus-source]

### :rotating_light: Go! Call Me (Maybe)!

Created to send emergency phone calls and text messages. Originally a Sinatra-based Ruby application
called _Alexa Alerter_, I converted this into a Go-based binary that works with [Twilio][twilio] and
can be uploaded to the [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] service, with environment variables controlling some
of the features. It then can have an [Alexa-based][amazon-echo] skill pointed towards it, enabling
features like, "tell Josh I need him".

* Go Source: [GitHub][go-call-me-maybe]
* Ruby Source: [GitHub][alexa-alerter-source]

### ü¶† Global Pandemic Goofs

This abomination of a website was created because of the absurdness of the global pandemic. At one
point, this pandemic will pass, and then this site will be useless, so we goof on it while we can. It
is a Ruby application utilizing Sinatra and has weighted logic to select random elements that make
up the phrases. It reads from text files to provide options to replace the phrase, "In this global
pandemic?", with something like, "In this gleaming pop concert hall?", or "In this gothic Pulp Juice
And Smoothie Bar?" It even has a simple, but effective, API.

## :octocat: Open Source Contributions [:top:][top]

![Taylor Swift - Absolutely Epic][taylor-epic]

### :cat: Kitty

Migrated to a cross-platform terminal emulator called [kitty][kitty] and realized it did not support
the default Emoji keyboard on MacOS. Submitted a PR which added the missing support, and
(although the PR was closed), it was addressed minutes later in a new commit by the maintainer,
with a reference included.

* Pull Request: [GitHub][kitty-pr]
* Commit: [GitHub][kitty-commit]

### :traffic_light: Stoplight Admin

Found two bugs in the project related to a previous user's PR. One related to support for the Redis
version dependency being increased when it made no sense, the other related to missing library
support for `sinatra/json`. I fixed both the bugs, as well as introduced tests into the project to
make sure that the core framework would load.

* Redis Pull Request: [GitHub][stoplight-redis-pr]
* Tests Pull Request: [GitHub][stoplight-tests-pr]

### :zap: Turbolinks

Discovered an IE8-related bug in Turbolinks and submitted a PR to the project to fix it.
