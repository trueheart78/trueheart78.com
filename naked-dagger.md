## Champion Gundyr

I was never able to catch my first run on video, but here's my second run. Unlike
on the first kill, this time, it was without parrying (a feat I thought nigh
impossible).

## Twin Princes

### First Run

During my first run, the Twin Princes killed me consistently. Even when I wasn't
doing a NDR, I was not skillful enough to fight them efficiently. After something
like 70 attempts or more, I finally took down the Twin Princes.

### Second Run

My second run definitely showed off more skill, and I'm glad, because I really
did not want to spend hours fighting them again.

## Nameless King

So far, this victory is my proudest. This is the only time I've actually ever
beaten Nameless King, and the fact that I did it during a NDR makes it even
sweeter.

## Rules

A naked dagger run is a type of challenge run I created for myself after watching
certain streamers take down bosses with no armor. I wanted to do that, as well.

Restrictions:

1. CANNOT wear armor.
1. CANNOT use a weapon that is not considered a dagger.
1. CANNOT use throwing items to damage enemies that are not knives or daggers.
1. CANNOT summon other PC or NPCs.
1. CANNOT use magic.

Unrestricted:

1. CAN use offhand weapons, like paired daggers or a parrying dagger.
1. CAN parry and riposte.
1. CAN work with quest givers during fights, like Siegward.
1. CAN wear any ring.
1. CAN use weapon buffs.
