A naked dagger run is a type of challenge run I created for myself after watching
certain streamers take down bosses with no armor. I wanted to do that, as well.

Rules:

1. CANNOT wear armor.
1. CANNOT use a weapon that is not considered a dagger.
1. CAN use offhand weapons, like paired daggers or a parrying dagger.
1. CANNOT use throwing items that are not knives or daggers.
1. CANNOT summon other PC or NPCs.
1. CAN work with quest givers during fights, like Siegward.
1. CAN wear any ring.

## Champion Gundyr

I was never able to catch my first run on video, but here's my second run. Unlike
on the first kill, this time, it was without parrying (a feat I thought nigh
impossible).

## Twin Princes

### First Run

During my first run, the Twin Princes killed me consistently. Even when I wasn't
doing a NDR, I was not skillful enough to fight them efficiently. After something
like 70 attempts or more, I finally too down the Twin Princes.

### Second Run

My second run definitely showed off more skill, and I'm glad, because I really
did not want to spend hours fighting them again.

## Nameless King

So far, this victory is my proudest. This is the only time I've actually ever
beaten Nameless King, and the fact that I did it during a NDR makes it even
sweeter.
